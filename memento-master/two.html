					<p class="storyText">EARL OPENS ONE EYE after another to a stretch of white ceiling tiles interrupted by <a href="four.html">a hand-printed sign taped right above his head</a>, large enough for him to read from the bed. An alarm clock is ringing somewhere. He reads the sign, blinks, reads it again, then takes a look at the room.</p>

					<p class="storyText"><a href="six.html">It's a white room</a>, overwhelmingly white, from the walls and the curtains to the institutional furniture and the bedspread. The alarm clock is ringing from the white desk under the window with the white curtains. At this point Earl probably notices that he is lying on top of his white comforter. He is already wearing a dressing gown and slippers.</p>

					<p class="storyText">He lies back and reads the sign taped to the ceiling again. It says, in crude block capitals, <span class="allCaps">THIS IS YOUR ROOM. THIS IS A ROOM IN A HOSPITAL. THIS IS WHERE YOU LIVE NOW.</span></p>

					<p class="storyText">Earl rises and takes a look around. The room is large for a hospital&#8212;empty linoleum stretches out from the bed in three directions. Two doors and a window. The view isn't very helpful, either&#45;a close of trees in the center of a <A HREF="four.html">carefully manicured piece of turf</a> that terminates in a sliver of two-lane blacktop. The trees, except for the evergreens, are bare&#45;early spring or late fall, one or the other.</p>

					<p class="storyText"><a href="four.html">Every inch of the desk is covered</a> with Post-it notes, legal pads, neatly printed lists, psychological textbooks, framed pictures. On top of the mess is a half-completed crossword puzzle. The alarm clock is riding a pile of folded newspapers. Earl slaps the snooze button and takes a cigarette from the pack taped to the sleeve of his dressing gown. He pats the empty pockets of his pajamas for a light. He rifles the papers on the desk, looks quickly through the drawers. Eventually he finds a box of kitchen matches taped to the wall next to the window. Another sign is taped just above the box. It says in loud yellow letters, <span class="allCaps">CIGARETTE? CHECK FOR LIT ONES FIRST, STUPID.</span></p>

					<p class="storyText">Earl laughs at the sign, lights his cigarette, and takes a long draw. Taped to the window in front of him is another piece of looseleaf paper headed <a href="five.html">YOUR SCHEDULE.</a></p>

					<p class="storyText">It charts off the hours, every hour, in blocks: 10:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. is labeled go <span class="allCaps">BACK TO SLEEP</span>. Earl consults the alarm clock: 8:15. Given the light outside, it must be morning. He checks his watch: 10:30. He presses the watch to his ear and listens. He gives the watch a wind or two and sets it to match the alarm clock.</p>

					<p class="storyText">According to the schedule, the entire block from 8:00 to 8:30 has been labeled <span class="allCaps">BRUSH YOUR TEETH</span>. Earl laughs again and walks over to the bathroom.</p>

					<p class="storyText">The bathroom window is open. As he flaps his arms to keep warm, he notices the ashtray on the windowsill. A cigarette is perched on the ashtray, burning steadily through a long finger of ash. He frowns, extinguishes the old butt, and replaces it with the new one.</p>

					<p class="storyText">The toothbrush has already been treated to a smudge of white paste. The tap is of the push-button variety—a dose of water with each nudge. Earl pushes the brush into his cheek and fiddles it back and forth while he opens the medicine cabinet. The shelves are stocked with single-serving packages of vitamins, aspirin, antidiuretics. The mouthwash is also single-serving, about a shot-glass-worth of blue liquid in a sealed plastic bottle. Only the toothpaste is regular-sized. Earl spits the paste out of his mouth and replaces it with the mouthwash. As he lays the toothbrush next to the toothpaste, he notices a tiny wedge of paper pinched between the glass shelf and the steel backing of the medicine cabinet. He spits the frothy blue fluid into the sink and nudges for some more water to rinse it down. He closes the medicine cabinet and smiles at <a href="seven.html">his reflection in the mirror.</a></p>

					<p class="storyText">"Who needs half an hour to brush their teeth?"</p>

					<p class="storyText">The paper has been folded down to a minuscule size with all the precision of a sixth-grader's love note. Earl unfolds it and smooths it against the mirror. It reads&#8212;</p>

					<p class="storyText allCaps">IF YOU CAN STILL READ THIS, THEN YOU'RE A FUCKING COWARD.</p>

					<p class="storyText ">Earl stares blankly at the paper, then reads it again. He turns it over. On the back it reads—</p>

					<p class="storyText allCaps">P.S. : <a href="three.html">AFTER YOU'VE READ THIS, HIDE IT AGAIN</a>.</p>

					<p class="storyText">Earl reads both sides again, then folds the note back down to its original size and tucks it underneath the toothpaste.</p>

					<p class="storyText">Maybe then <a href="four.html">he notices the scar</a>. It begins just beneath the ear, jagged and thick, and disappears abruptly into his hairline. Earl turns his head and stares out of the corner of his eye to follow the scar's progress. He traces it with a fingertip, then looks back down at the cigarette burning in the ashtray. A thought seizes him and he spins out of the bathroom.</p>

					<p class="storyText">He is caught at the door to his room, one hand on the knob. Two pictures are taped to the wall by the door. Earl's attention is caught first by the MRI, a shiny black frame for four windows into someone's skull. In marker, <a href="one.html">the picture is labeled <span class="allCaps">YOUR BRAIN</span></a>. Earl stares at it. Concentric circles in different colors. He can make out the big orbs of his eyes and, behind these, the twin lobes of his brain. Smooth wrinkles, circles, semicircles. But right there in the middle of his head, circled in marker, tunneled in from the back of his neck like a maggot into an apricot, is something different. Deformed, broken, but unmistakable. A dark smudge, the shape of a flower, right there in the middle of his brain.</p>

					<p class="storyText">He bends to look at the other picture. <a href="one.html">It is a photograph of a man holding flowers</a>, standing over a fresh grave. The man is bent over, reading the headstone. For a moment this looks like a hall of mirrors or the beginnings of a sketch of infinity: the one man bent over, looking at the smaller man, bent over, reading the headstone. Earl looks at the picture for a long time. Maybe he begins to cry. Maybe he just stares silently at the picture. Eventually, he makes his way back to the bed, flops down, seals his eyes shut, tries to sleep.</p>

					<p class="storyText">The cigarette burns steadily away in the bathroom. A circuit in the alarm clock counts down from ten, and it starts ringing again.</p>

					<p class="storyText">Earl opens one eye after another to a stretch of white ceiling tiles, interrupted by a hand-printed sign taped right above his head, large enough for him to read from the bed.</p>
