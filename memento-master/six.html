					<p class="storyText">HE CAN HEAR THE BUZZING through his eyelids. Insistent. <a href="four.html">He reaches out for the alarm clock,</a> but he can't move his arm.</p>

					<p class="storyText">Earl opens his eyes to see a large man bent double over him. The man looks up at him, annoyed, then resumes his work. Earl looks around him. <a href="two.html">Too dark for a doctor's office</a>.</p>

					<p class="storyText">Then the pain floods his brain, blocking out the other questions. He squirms again, trying to yank his forearm away, the one that feels like it's burning. The arm doesn't move, but the man shoots him another scowl. Earl adjusts himself in the chair to see over the top of the man's head.</p>

					<p class="storyText">The noise and the pain are both coming from a gun in the man's hand&#8212;a gun with a needle where the barrel should be. The needle is digging into the fleshy underside of Earl's forearm, leaving a trail of puffy letters behind it.</p>

					<p class="storyText">Earl tries to rearrange himself to get a better view, to read the letters on his arm, but he can't. He lies back and <a href="four.html">stares at the ceiling.</a></p>

					<p class="storyText">Eventually the tattoo artist turns off the noise, wipes Earl's forearm with a piece of gauze, and wanders over to the back to dig up a pamphlet describing how to deal with a possible infection. Maybe later he'll tell his wife about this guy and his little note. Maybe his wife will convince him to call the police.</p>

					<p class="storyText">Earl looks down at the arm. The letters are rising up from the skin, weeping a little. They run from just behind the strap of Earl's watch all the way to the inside of his elbow. Earl blinks at the message and reads it again. It says, in careful little capitals, <span class="allCaps">I RAPED AND KILLED YOUR WIFE.</span></p>
