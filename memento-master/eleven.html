					<p class="selfText">"You'd be late for your own funeral," she'd say. Remember? The more I think about it, the more trite that seems. What kind of idiot, after all, is in any kind of rush to get to the end of his own story?</p>

					<p class="selfText">And how would I know if I were late, anyway? I don't have a watch anymore. I don't know what we did with it.</p>

					<p class="selfText">What the hell do you need a watch for, anyway? It was an antique. Deadweight tugging at your wrist. Symbol of the old you. <a href="one.html">The you that believed in time.</a></p>

					<p class="selfText">No. Scratch that. It's not so much that you've lost your faith in time as that time has lost its faith in you. And who needs it, anyway? Who wants to be one of those saps living in the safety of the future, in the safety of the moment after the moment in which they felt something powerful? Living in the next moment, in which they feel nothing. Crawling down the hands of the clock, away from the people who did unspeakable things to them. Believing the lie that time will heal all wounds—which is just a nice way of saying that time deadens us.</p>

					<p class="selfText">But you're different. <a href="five.html">You're more perfect.</a> Time is three things for most people, but for you, for us, just one. A singularity. One moment. This moment. Like you're the center of the clock, the axis on which the hands turn. Time moves about you but never moves you. It has lost its ability to affect you. What is it they say? That <a href="three.html">time is theft?</a> But not for you. Close your eyes and you can start all over again. Conjure up that necessary emotion, fresh as roses.</p>

					<p class="selfText">Time is an absurdity. An abstraction. The only thing that matters is this moment. This moment a million times over. You have to trust me. If this moment is repeated enough, if you keep trying—and you have to keep trying—eventually you will come across the <a href="five.html">next item on your list.</a></p>
