					<p class="storyText">THE LITTLE MECHANICAL VOICE PAUSES, then repeats itself. It says, "The time is 8:00 a.m. This is a courtesy call." Earl opens his eyes and replaces the receiver. The phone is perched on a cheap veneer headboard that stretches behind the bed, curves to meet the corner, and ends at the minibar. The TV is still on, blobs of flesh color nattering away at each other. Earl lies back down and is surprised to see himself, older now, tanned, the hair pulling away from his head like solar flares. The mirror on the ceiling is cracked, the silver fading in creases. Earl continues to stare at himself, astonished by what he sees. <a href="four.html">He is fully dressed</a>, but the clothes are old, threadbare in places.</p>

					<p class="storyText">Earl feels the familiar spot on his left wrist for his watch, <a href="seven.html">but it's gone.</a> He looks down from the mirror to his arm. It is bare and the skin has changed to an even tan, as if he never owned a watch in the first place. The skin is even in color except for the solid black arrow on the inside of Earl's wrist, pointing up his shirtsleeve. He stares at the arrow for a moment. Perhaps he doesn't try to rub it off anymore. He rolls up his sleeve.</p>

					<p class="storyText">The arrow points to a sentence tattooed along Earl's inner arm. Earl reads the sentence once, maybe twice. Another arrow picks up at the beginning of the sentence, points farther up Earl's arm, disappearing under the rolled-up shirtsleeve. He unbuttons his shirt.</p>

					<p class="storyText">Looking down on his chest, he can make out the shapes but cannot bring them into focus, so he looks up at the mirror above him.</p>

					<p class="storyText">The arrow leads up Earl's arm, crosses at the shoulder, and descends onto his upper torso, terminating at a picture of a man's face that occupies most of his chest. <a href="ten.html">The face is that of a large man, balding, with a mustache and a goatee.</a> It is a particular face, but like a police sketch it has a certain unreal quality.</p>

					<p class="storyText">The rest of his upper torso is covered in words, phrases, bits of information, and instructions, all of them written backward on Earl, forward in the mirror.</p>

					<p class="storyText">Eventually Earl sits up, buttons his shirt, and crosses to the desk. He takes out a pen and a piece of notepaper from the desk drawer, sits, <a href="nine.html">and begins to write.</a></p>
