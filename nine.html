					<p class="selfText"><a href="six.html">I don't know where you'll be</a> when you read this. I'm not even sure if you'll bother to read this. I guess you don't need to.</p>

					<p class="selfText">It's a shame, really, that you and I will never meet. But, like the song says, "By the time you read this note, I'll be gone."</p>

					<p class="selfText">We're so close now. That's the way it feels. So many pieces put together, spelled out. I guess it's just a matter of time until you find him.</p>

					<p class="selfText">Who knows what we've done to get here? Must be a hell of a story, if only you could remember any of it. I guess it's better that you can't.</p>

					<p class="selfText">I had a thought just now. Maybe you'll find it useful.</p>

					<p class="selfText">Everybody is waiting for the end to come, but what if it already passed us by? What if the final joke of Judgment Day was that it had already come and gone and we were none the wiser? Apocalypse arrives quietly; the chosen are herded off to heaven, and the rest of us, the ones who failed the test, just keep on going, oblivious. Dead already, wandering around long after the gods have stopped keeping score, still optimistic about the future.</p>

					<p class="selfText">I guess if that's true, then it doesn't matter what you do. No expectations. If you can't find him, then it doesn't matter, because nothing matters. And if you do find him, then you can kill him without worrying about the consequences. Because there are no consequences.</p>

					<p class="selfText">That's what I'm thinking about right now, in this scrappy little room. <a href="two.html">Framed pictures of ships on the wall.</a> I don't know, obviously, but if I had to guess, I'd say we're somewhere up the coast. If you're wondering why your left arm is five shades browner than your right, I don't know what to tell you. I guess we must have been driving for a while. And, no, I don't know what happened to your watch.</p>

					<p class="selfText"><a href="four.html">And all these keys:</a> I have no idea. Not a one that I recognize. Car keys and house keys and the little fiddly keys for padlocks. What have we been up to?</p>

					<p class="selfText">I wonder if he'll feel stupid when you find him. Tracked down by the ten-minute man. Assassinated by a vegetable.</p>

					<p class="selfText">I'll be gone in a moment. I'll put down the pen, close my eyes, and then you can read this through if you want.</p>

					<p class="selfText">I just wanted you to know that I'm proud of you. <a href="index.html">No one who matters</a> is left to say it. No one left is going to want to.</p>
